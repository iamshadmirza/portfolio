## Use pnpm / yarn

If you want to use pnpm or yarn as a package management tool, please refer to the following steps.

> If `preinstall` exists in `scripts`, remove it first.

### pnpm

Replace `"pre-commit": "npx lint-staged"` in package.json with `"pre-commit": "pnpm lint-staged"`.

And replace `"*": "npm run lint:fix"` with `"*": "pnpm lint:fix"`.

Like this:

```json
{
  // ...
  "simple-git-hooks": {
    "pre-commit": "pnpm lint-staged"
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*": "pnpm lint:fix"
  }
}
```

### yarn

Replace `"pre-commit": "npx lint-staged"` in package.json with `"pre-commit": "yarn lint-staged"`.

And replace `"*": "npm run lint:fix"` with `"*": "yarn lint:fix"`.

Like this:

```json
{
  // ...
  "simple-git-hooks": {
    "pre-commit": "yarn lint-staged"
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*": "yarn lint:fix"
  }
}
```
